## Pricing Psychology & Selling Notes

### Why these numbers?
- **$397** ends in 7 (proven conversion psychology), under $400 feels accessible
- **$1,097** positions as premium but justified — anchored against the $3,997 tier
- **$3,997** under $4K psychological barrier, premium enough to filter tire-kickers

### Annual discount strategy
- 15% off for annual prepay
- Frame it as "2 months free" — sounds better than "15% off"
- Improves your cash flow dramatically ($11K upfront vs. $1,097/month)

### Objection handling

**"That's too expensive"**
→ "I understand. Let me ask — how much is your time worth per hour? If this saves you 10 hours a week at $50/hour, that's $2,000/month in time back. The Professional plan costs $1,097. You're actually MAKING $900/month by investing in this."

**"I can just use ChatGPT"**
→ "You absolutely can — and I use Claude and ChatGPT daily. The difference is: can ChatGPT log into your email, draft responses in your voice, schedule your appointments, and follow up with leads automatically? That's what a custom AI agent does. ChatGPT is a tool. This is a system."

**"Can I try it first?"**
→ "I offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you don't see the value in the first month, you get your money back. But honestly, most clients see results in the first week."

**"I'm not technical"**
→ "Neither am I — I'm a business owner who learned AI by doing. That's exactly why I built EasyAiFlows: so you DON'T have to be technical. I handle everything. You just tell me what's eating your time."

**"Why not hire a freelancer?"**
→ "A freelancer builds it and walks away. I build it, optimize it weekly, and evolve it as your business grows. Plus, a decent AI freelancer charges $50K-$150K per project. You get ongoing service for a fraction of that."

## Upsell Path

**Month 1-3:** Client starts on Starter ($397/mo)
**Month 4-6:** Add second AI agent (+$350/mo) → effectively at Professional pricing
**Month 6-12:** Upgrade to Professional ($1,097/mo) for full support
**Year 2:** Some clients upgrade to Enterprise or add team training

**Target:** Move 30-40% of Starter clients to Professional within 6 months.
