# EasyAiFlows — Demo Script & Sales Materials

---

## 5-MINUTE LIVE DEMO SCRIPT

Use this on sales calls when sharing your screen. Open the EasyAI bot at http://100.95.12.72:50001 before the call.

---

### Minute 0-1: Setup

**Say:** "Let me show you something real quick. This is a custom AI assistant I built and use every day to run my business. It's branded EasyAiFlows — this is exactly what I'd build for you."

**Do:** Open the EasyAI web UI. Show the login screen with the EasyAiFlows branding.

**Say:** "Notice this isn't ChatGPT. This is a private AI agent that knows MY business — my leads, my schedule, my voice. Nobody else has access to it."

---

### Minute 1-2: Show a real task

**Say:** "Watch this. I'm going to ask it to help me with something I'd normally spend 30 minutes on."

**Type into the bot:**
> "Draft follow-up messages for my 3 hottest leads this week. Keep it casual and personal."

**While it works, say:** "See how it's thinking through this? It knows who my leads are, what we've talked about, and how I like to communicate. This isn't generic — it's MY voice."

**When results appear:** "There — 3 personalized messages ready to go. I review, tweak if needed, and send. What used to take 30 minutes took 60 seconds."

---

### Minute 2-3: Show versatility

**Say:** "But it's not just messages. Watch this."

**Type:**
> "What's on my schedule this week and what should I prioritize?"

**Say:** "It can manage your calendar, prioritize your tasks, do research, draft emails, handle customer questions — whatever you need. And it learns over time. The more you use it, the better it gets."

---

### Minute 3-4: Connect to THEIR pain

**Say:** "So let me ask you — what's the ONE thing that eats up most of your time every week?"

**[Let them answer]**

**Say:** "That's exactly the kind of thing we'd automate first. Imagine having an AI that handles [their answer] for you every single day. How many hours would that save you?"

**[Let them answer]**

**Say:** "And that's just ONE workflow. Most of our clients automate 3-5 processes and save 10+ hours a week."

---

### Minute 4-5: Close

**Say:** "Here's how it works. I build a custom AI assistant specifically for your business. I set it up, I train it on your workflows, and I support you weekly to make sure it's delivering results."

**Say:** "We have three plans starting at $397 a month. Most business owners go with the Professional plan because it includes multiple AI agents and weekly strategy calls. But we can figure out what makes sense for you."

**Say:** "Want me to walk you through what a setup would look like for YOUR business?"

## OBJECTION HANDLING QUICK REFERENCE

| They Say | You Say |
|----------|---------|
| "Sounds expensive" | "What's your time worth per hour? If this saves 10 hrs/week at $50/hr, you're saving $2K/month for a $397-$1,097 investment." |
| "I can use ChatGPT" | "ChatGPT is great for one-off questions. But can it log into your email, send follow-ups, and manage your pipeline automatically? That's the difference between a tool and a system." |
| "I'm not technical" | "Neither was I. That's literally why I built this — so you don't have to be. I handle all the tech. You just tell me what's wasting your time." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Totally get it. How about this — book a second call for next week, and in the meantime I'll put together a custom plan showing exactly what I'd automate for your business. No commitment." |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you don't see the value in the first month, you get your money back. Most clients see results in the first week." |
| "Can I see other clients' results?" | "We're early — I'm building my first client base right now. That means you get founding-member pricing AND my full personal attention. My own results: 3 iOS apps built with AI, and I run my entire business with this same system." |
